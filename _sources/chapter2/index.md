The **War of the Romantics** (German: *Parteienstreit*) was a 19th-century debate about the future of music after Beethoven. It divided composers, critics, and audiences into opposing camps-and generated the correspondence networks preserved in the SoNAR database.

## The Two Camps

| "Absolute Music" (Brahms) | "Music of the Future" (Wagner) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Music as pure form | Music as expression |
| Classical traditions | Innovation and progress |
| Symphony, sonata, chamber music | Opera, tone poem, music drama |
| **Allies:** Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, Eduard Hanslick | **Allies:** Franz Liszt, Anton Bruckner, Hugo Wolf |

In **1860**, Brahms and Joachim published a manifesto rejecting the "New German School"-marking the open break between camps.

(correspondence)=
## Why Correspondence Matters

Before telephones and email, **letters** were how musicians stayed connected-for professional business, artistic exchange, alliance building, and personal friendship.

```{admonition} Interpretation Caution
:class: warning

- **No edge does not mean no relationship**-letters may be lost
- **Famous composers' letters survived more often**-survival bias
- **Edges don't show relationship quality**-friendly or hostile look the same
