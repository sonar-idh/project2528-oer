Social Network Analysis and related Research (2026). _Historical Network Analysis with SoNAR._ QUADRIGA Open Educational Resources. https://github.com/sonar-idh/SoNAR

````
`````


Welcome to this Open Educational Resource on **Historical Network Analysis (HNA)** using the **SoNAR data marketplace**.

This resource will teach you how to analyze historical correspondence networks. Our case study focuses on the **War of the Romantics**-a 19th-century aesthetic conflict that divided the musical world into opposing camps around figures like Johannes Brahms, Richard Wagner, and Franz Liszt.

By exploring their letters and connections, you will discover how network analysis can reveal patterns of communication, influence, and alliance that traditional historical methods might overlook.

## What You'll Learn

This resource covers three main areas:

- **Network Basics** - Understand the fundamental concepts of network analysis: nodes, edges, centrality measures, and how relationships form meaningful patterns.
- **Using SoNAR** - Navigate the SoNAR interface to explore correspondence networks through both visual graphs and structured data tables.
- **Research Skills** - Formulate historical research questions and use network data to find answers about social connections in the past.

## The SoNAR Data Marketplace

SoNAR (Social Network Analysis and related Research) is a data marketplace containing correspondence data from the War of the Romantics period. It provides two complementary ways to explore this historical network:

- **Visual Graph** - An interactive network visualization showing who corresponded with whom. Nodes represent people, and edges represent correspondence relationships.
- **Data Table** - A structured view of the correspondence data with five columns: Source, Target, Type, Label, and Date.

```{admonition} Interactive Filtering
:class: tip

The table allows you to select specific sources and targets and combine them using a Boolean **OR** operator. When you filter the data, the visual graph updates instantly to show only the selected correspondents.
```

## Chapter Overview

This resource is organized into six chapters that build progressively on each other:

- **Chapter 1** introduces the core concepts, terminology, and the value of network thinking for historical research (see {doc}`chapter1/index`).
- **Chapter 2** provides historical context, key figures, and the role of correspondence in 19th-century musical life (see {doc}`chapter2/index`).
- **Chapter 3** explains the data structure, sources, and what the data marketplace contains (see {doc}`chapter3/index`).
- **Chapter 4** offers a hands-on guide to using the visual graph, data table, and filtering options (see {doc}`chapter4/index`).
- **Chapter 5** covers formulating research questions and conducting your own network-based investigations (see {doc}`chapter5/index`).
- **Chapter 6** provides key takeaways, glossary, bibliography, and further resources for continued learning (see {doc}`chapter6/index`).

## Who Is This For?

This resource is designed for beginners with no prior experience in network analysis. It is suitable for:

- **History and musicology students** interested in digital research methods
- **Digital humanities beginners** looking for a practical, hands-on introduction
- **Researchers and educators** who want to incorporate network analysis into their work
- **Anyone curious** about how correspondence networks can illuminate historical relationships

```{admonition} No Prerequisites
:class: note

You do not need any prior experience with network analysis, programming, or 19th-century music history. All concepts are explained from the ground up, and the SoNAR interface is designed to be intuitive for first-time users.
